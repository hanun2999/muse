# muse

Muse's goal is to be a virtual instrument synthesizer library for Rust developers to programattically play music in their programs.

This crate is currently published in a pre-release state to lock the name in. If the project stagnates before anything meaningful is published, and you want this name, please contact me, and I will relinquish the name. My goal was to lock in the name at the start of development, not to squat indefinitely on a name.
