# muse

Muse's goal is to be the music platform for composing original music for [ncog](https://github.com/khonsulabs/ncog).

A counterpart program, [amuse](./amuse), is aimed at being a fun MIDI and scripting-driven synthesizer for live music playback. The goal of this program is mostly to be something fun for [the author's Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/ectonDev) and will likely eventually include ways for viewers to interact.
