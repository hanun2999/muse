# amuse

Amuse is a live music performance program that controls virtual instruments (provided by [muse](../muse) ) via MIDI and scripting.

This crate is currently published in a pre-release state to lock the name in. If the project stagnates before anything meaningful is published, and you want this name, please contact me, and I will relinquish the name. My goal was to lock in the name at the start of development, not to squat indefinitely on a name.
